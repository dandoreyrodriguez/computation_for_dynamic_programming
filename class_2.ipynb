    "In class 1, we learned to do basic value function iteration (VFI) with even grid disretisation in economies with a discrete stochastic state. The aims of class 2 are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to deploy recursive tools to tackle continuous stochastic state processes\n",
    "2. Learn how to compute full recursive competitive equilibria, both by invoking the Welfare Theorems and through other means\n",

    "Though the primary goal of this series is to learn to actually *do* the computation, a secondary goal is to solve meaningful models and illuminate the economic mechanisms at play. This class will consider a host of serious macro models; serious in their own right and in the history of the discipline. "

    "## Example 4: Lucas Asset Pricing Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas introduced in lucas' asset pricing tree (*Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy*, 1978)\n",
    "are both exhilarating and the perfect pedagogical next step. Lucas' tree will allow us to tackle continuous stochastic states. In addition, it will open a low-cost way to think rigorously about equilibrium asset prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is simple. Imagine there is one unit of an asset pricing \"tree\" which yields $z_t$ units of dividends (fruits) at time $t\\in\\{0,1,...\\}$. $z_t >0$ is continuous and stochastic. There is a unit mass of consumers who trade shares of the tree. That is, the $i$ th individual brings $v_{i,t}$ units of shares into period $t$. The agent then chooses how many shares to hold, $v_{i,t+1}$, in that period to take to the following. Consumers have utility function $u(c)$ with the same properties as assumed in Class 1. The good consumed is the same good as that produced by the tree. Unlike the social planner, who can simply ignore prices, consumers take prices as given $p(z)$. It is a function of dividends as these fruits perfectly define the state of the aggregate economy. \n",

    "Luckily, under one further assumption we can learn about equilibrium prices in a low cost way. Suppose that everyone inherits the same number of shares in period 0: $v_{i,-1} = v_{-1}, \\forall i \\in [0,1]$. Realise that, in this case, $v_{i,0} = v_{0}, \\forall i \\in [0,1]$. This will also be true in every period! Since share purchases are identical across the economy, $c_{i,t} = c_{t}, \\forall i \\in [0,1]$. Consumption is constant across individuals. This will help us stay in the \"representative agent\" world. By definition (we will define many other RCEs more formally in this and future classes), markets clear in an RCE. The only is resource is $z_t$. Hence, market clearing implies that $c_t = z_t$ in every period. This is great news. Under equal inheritence, \n",
